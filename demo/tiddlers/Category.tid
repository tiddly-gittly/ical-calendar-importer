title: Category
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
tags: Index

We use calendar's name to create a category tiddler, and add it as a tag to all events in this calendar. Calendar's description will be added to this tag tiddler's text field.

!!! Edge cases

If the calendar don't have a name, we will use a random number ID as a fallback, you can rename it later.
