# ICal Calendar Importer for TiddlyWiki5

See [Demo Site](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/ical-calendar-importer) for details.

This can be used with [tiddly-gittly/tiddlywiki-calendar](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tiddlywiki-calendar).

Install it from [the CPL](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TiddlyWiki-CPL).

## During development

There are some scripts you can run to boost your development.

After `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`:

- `npm run dev` to pack the plugin in the `dist/` directory, this will setup a site that will auto reload when you have changes. But this is development mode, will produce a much larget bundle than the final version, so only for dev.
- `npm run dev-html` to setup the demo site locally. Re-run this command and refresh browser to see changes. In this way you can see the real bundle size same as your user will get.

You will need `--legacy-peer-deps` when `npm i` if you are using latest nodejs. This is a bug in npm.

### Add a second ts file

Add new file name (without `.ts`) to `package.json`'s `tsFiles` field. And build script will read it and compile files in it.

## After the plugin is complete

### Publish

Enable github action in your repo (in your github repo - setting - action - general) if it is not allowed, and when you tagging a new version `vx.x.x` in a git commit and push, it will automatically publish to the github release.

### Demo

You will get a Github Pages demo site automatically after publish. If it is 404, you may need to manually enable Github Pages in your github repo:

Settings - Pages (on left side) - Source - choose `gh-pages` branch

## Trouble Shooting

### â–² [WARNING] Import "useFilter" will always be undefined because the file "node_modules/tw-react/dist/plugins/linonetwo/tw-react/index.js" has no exports

See [tw-react](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/tw-react/blob/eb858d33737bfa6cff35f58f27770321080980f6/esbuild.config.mjs#L35-L43)'s esbuild config, you will need to exclude the file from the modification here.
